# Voca

I'd like to save words or phrases I don't know while reading, working, or listening to something in English and then study them later.
So I created this app to help me do that.

## Features

- Add words or phrases to a list
- Data is stored as CSV file and automatically pushed to Github
- Pick least read word or phrase and explain/translate with example with a single command
- Use AI (Copilot) to explain/translate with example
